                Amazon, founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, is a global e-commerce and technology giant headquartered in Seattle, Washington.
                <br>
                Initially an online bookstore, it has since expanded into a wide array of products and services, including cloud computing (Amazon Web Services), streaming media (Amazon Prime Video), artificial intelligence, and more. <br>
                Amazon is known for its customer-centric approach, rapid delivery services, and innovations like Alexa and Kindle.
                <br>
                It has also ventured into physical retail with Whole Foods Market and Amazon Go stores. As one of the world's largest companies by market capitalization, Amazon plays a significant role in the global economy.
